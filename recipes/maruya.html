    <div class="hook">A sweet delight!</div>        
    <div>This delightful treat consists of ripe saba bananas, lovingly coated in a batter that 
        crisps up to golden perfection when fried. The result is a delectable contrast of textures, 
        with a crunchy outer layer that gives way to a soft, sweet, and slightly creamy banana 
        interior. Maruya is often enjoyed with a dusting of sugar and a touch of nostalgia, making 
        it a timeless Filipino favorite.</div>

    <div class="section">Ingredients (Serves 2-4 persons)</div>    
    <ul>
        <li>4 ripe saba bananas</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)</li>
        <li>Cooking oil for frying</li>
        <li>Powdered sugar for dusting</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="section">Procedure</div>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Bananas:
            <ul>
                <li>Peel the ripe saba bananas and slice them into thin, even pieces. 
                    Some don't slice all the way through to shape the banana into a fan.</li>
                <li>You can use more banana to maximize the volume of the batter mixture. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Create the Batter:
            <ul>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, combine all-purpose flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Mix well.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Make Batter Mixture:
            <ul>
                <li>In the same bowl, add the egg, milk, and vanilla extract (if using).</li>
                <li>Mix the ingredients together until you have a smooth, lump-free batter. 
                    The batter should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon but still pourable.</li>
                <li>If the batter mixture is too thin, add more flour. If it is too thick, add more water.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Heat the Oil:
            <ul>
                <li>In a frying pan or deep skillet, heat enough cooking oil over medium heat for deep frying. 
                    You can test if the oil is hot enough by dropping a small amount of batter into it; if it sizzles and floats, it's ready.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Dip and Fry:
            <ul>
                <li>Dip banana slices in the batter and coat them evenly.</li>
                <li>Carefully fry the coated slices in hot oil until they turn golden brown and crispy (about 2-3 minutes per side).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Serve:
            <ul>
                <li>Drain the fried Maruya on paper towels and optionally dust with powdered sugar.</li>
                <li>Serve warm as a delightful Filipino snack or dessert.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <div class="coda">Maruya is a delightful Filipino treat that's perfect for satisfying your sweet cravings and sharing with friends and family. 
        Enjoy the crispiness of the batter and the sweetness of the bananas in every bite!</div>
